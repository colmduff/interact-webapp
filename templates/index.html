            <h3 class ="head">About the INTERACT Project</h3>
            <p align="justify">Over the next decade approximately 175 million children will be affected by
                climate related disasters and 25 million children will experience undernourishment
                as an impact of climate change.

            <p align="justify">People of all ages, but younger generations in particular, are increasingly speaking out
                about climate and environmental issues through collective initiatives such as Youth for Climate
                and the 2019 Climate Strikes involving over 1 million young people across 125 countries worldwide.
                A UNICEF Australia Young Ambassador Report estimated that 86% of people aged 14 to 17 in Australia view
                climate change as a threat to their safety.</p>

            <P align="justify">Despite the growing urgency around climate change, it is still difficult for ordinary individuals to have meaningful
                input into the climate debate that will shape the future of our planet. Until recently young people have been all but excluded
                from the debate. Youth climate action strikers have consequently termed their generation, ‘the voiceless future of humanity”.
                </p>

            <p align="justify">
                The INTERACT project (<strong>INTER</strong>national survey on climate <strong>ACT</strong>ion) aims to engage a people in a data - action exchange. By this we mean that the data will
                be used constructively to stimulate positive action. We wish to use the data provided by the users to
                compare views, priorities and knowledge of climate change to the various regionalised policy priorities.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
                Secondly, we will use the data to generate a global dataset where annonomysed data can be compared against
                each other to show how views, priorities and knowledge of climate change differ between age, region, socio-economic
                background etc.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                Our main aim is to show the priorities gap between policymakers and those who will inherit this planet.
                With that in mind, and considering this is a passion project for those involved, our last objective is to
                use this pilot as a justification for a much wider study/initiative.
